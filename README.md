This React project is bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).

## Project Dependencies

- TailwindCSS ([Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/))
- daisyUI ([Documentation](https://daisyui.com/docs/))
- Firebase ([Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs))
- firebase-tools ([Documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase-tools))
- ESLint ([Documentation](https://eslint.org))
- Prettier ([Documentation](https://prettier.io))

## Firebase configuration

Before you can run your project locally, you will need your Firebase backend to be connected. When you create a new Firebase project, fill out your own `.env` with the project credentials. (Never share your sensitive project data!) See `.env.example` for the necessary fields required by the Firebase config in `/src/config/firebase.js`.

## Running Locally

Install the project dependencies with

```
npm i
```

After this, you should be able to run `npm run dev` to start the app on the development server.

## Development Tools (optional, but recommended)

For improved developer experience, we recommend installing the extensions for ESLint, Prettier, and Tailwind for your text editor or IDE.
